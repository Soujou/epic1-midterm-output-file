"There is always light in the world of darkness." 
In my mandala art, I chose three colors; Red, Black, and White. Every color has its meaning and uniqueness. The star is known as divine guidance, light, and protection. Red represents negativity and darkness, while white is purity or innocence. Black represents evil, mystery, and darkness. For me, colors define different personalities and describe how people feel. My mandala art, just shows how desires, pressure, and anxiety drive people crazy. Although they were eaten up by negativity, people still find a way to find a solution (to be happy or do something else for their attention will not focus on the negative such as taking their own lives). The references I had taken to accomplish its code is by watching various tutorials on different websites (YouTube and W3school).
